# Stock-Tweets
In this project we propose a learning-based stock market information system for stock prices prediction and customer satisfaction estimation to help stock market clients decide their investment. For future prices prediction, we use time series models that are trained using historical stock data of different companies. Particularly, ARIMA model is used for monthly prediction and FBprophet model is used for daily prediction. For customer satisfaction estimation, we analyze and process customer reviewing tweets using sentiment analysis and natural language processing to predict a score indicating the percentage of satisfaction about certain company. Also, in this project, we propose an enhanced approach that combines customer reviews with historical data to improve stock prices prediction using convolutional neural networks or polynomial regression. Model results are analyzed, and comparisons are made between different approaches to determine best model to be adopted for each problem. Finally, we develop a web application with suitable user interface and expressive analyzing graphs for convenient use of our system. As a proof of concept, all of our work is practically applied on stocks and reviewing tweets of different ten global companies.
